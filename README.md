# Networking Coffees vs. Formal Interviews

Interviews, whether networking/informational or formal interviews, require preparation and enthusiasm. All meetings are really job interviews, so don’t go unprepared! You never know if an informational meeting will lead to a job.  But there are differences between the two and this content will outline the differences between a networking/informational interview/coffee meeting and a formal job interview. Ready?

## What is the Purpose of the Informational Interview

The networking, informational interview, or the “coffee meeting” is a one-on-one conversation that you initiate in which you seek advice on your career, industry, culture etc.   You’re inviting someone in your network or someone you’ve met through a 2nd degree connection to meet and have a conversation. You can use these conversations to learn about a job and the skills and background that are considered a fit at a person’s company.  It’s good to talk with someone who works in the industry you want to learn about or has the specific job you are looking for. These meetings are a great way to practice your interview skills.  They are also useful if you know what type of job you want but could use some advice on breaking into the industry or that specific company.

A few things to note: 

- You requested this meeting. That means you are driving the conversation. Come prepared with questions, thoughts and notes.
- Since the other person’s time is valuable, know that you may have to wait or that the time scheduled may be cut short. These should not be taken as insulting or negatively in any way. People are busy.
- If you have a meeting like this in a coffee shop/cafe, offer to pay for the other person’s drink in exchange for their time and advice.

If you make a good impression, the person you meet may offer to refer you to people in their network or for job opportunities they know about.  It is not appropriate to explicitly ask for a job in a conversation like this. These situations are for advice, a forum to  answer your questions, and for general relationship building. 

## What is the Purpose of the Formal Interview

Formal interviews, on the other hand, are when you meet with a recruiter or hiring manager to discuss your qualifications and fit for an open role a company has. Unlike the networking interview, these are at the request of the company and usually have a set date, time and agenda. The company representative will drive the conversation (in the form of questions) and you should come prepared to showcase your experiences and your personality.

These interviews can be via video (e.g. Skype, Zoom, or Google Hangout), phone, or face-to-face. The traditional format for formal interviews are usually, but not in all cases, one-on-one interviews with managers, colleagues and/or HR. Generally, these are 30-60 minutes in length but be prepared to stay the entire day if asked. Also, don’t be surprised if you are asked to walk through a case study or do a presentation to a small group. Formal interviews often start with the interviewer asking you about *yourself*.

A few things to note: 

- If a coffee/meal is scheduled during your interview, it is customary for the company to pay the check. It’s a nice gesture to offer to pay. It’s also smart to have some cash on you just in case.
- Be prepared to stay longer or to end earlier. Schedules change quite frequently inside an organization and calendar availability shifts. Be flexible when you can but be upfront if you have a hard-stop at a certain time. 
- Many interviewers come unprepared so have an extra copy of your resume.
- Be prepared to repeat yourself, especially if you’re meeting numerous people one after the other. Do not say you already answered a question that was asked by a previous interviewer. Consider whatever you’re saying to be the first time you’ve ever said it.
- Have questions prepared for your interviewer(s). We go over how to prepare these questions in another lesson.

## What Outcomes Should I Expect from These Meetings? 

For a networking/informational interview, if you make a good impression, you may be referred to others for networking or job opportunities.  Or you might be invited to talk again. Worst case scenario, you made a friend/connection in the tech community.

For a formal interview, the best outcome would be either moving to the next round of the interview process, receiving a code challenge, or getting an offer. 

There’s an old saying to keep in mind: *“When you ask for advice you get a job. When you ask for a job you get advice.”* 

## Tips for Every Kind of Interview

- Engage and connect.  Eye contact and smiling are the best way to do this.
- Research the company and the people you know who are connected to the company before going into these interviews.  
- Write out your questions in advance and ask appropriate questions to the appropriate people.  
- Ask for a schedule or agenda in advance, if possible.
- Arrive 10 minutes early; but don’t arrive too early.
- If you’re running late, call. 
- Bring additional copies of your resume – especially if you have updates.
- Know the job description. No need to memorize but at least read it.
- Practice your handshake. Dead fishes are gross.
- Rehearse interview question answers but try not to sound “canned’.
- Finally, be yourself.
